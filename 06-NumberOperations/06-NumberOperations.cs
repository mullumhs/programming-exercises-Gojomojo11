PROJECT 06: NUMBER OPERATIONS
===============================================================================
Objective:
- Practice obtaining numerical input from the user and performing basic arithmetic operations.

Main Tasks:
1. Store user input as a floating point number for the variable 'y' as shown for 'x'.
2. Perform and output the result of multiplication using '*' with 'x' and 'y'.
3. Perform and output the result of subtraction using '-' with 'x' and 'y'.
4. Perform and output the result of division using '/' with 'x' and 'y'.
5. Wait for input before ending the program.

Questions:
1. What does "Convert.ToDouble" do?
Converts the value of the specified object to an double-precision floating-point number, using the specified culture-specific formatting information.
2. What is a parameter? Give an example of where you have used one.
a set of facts or a fixed limit that establishes or limits how something can or must happen or be done
3. Why is the 'Console.ReadLine()' a parameter to Convert.ToDouble()?
because you need to press something to get to the other one
Extension Tasks:
1. Modify the program to work with the 'double' type.
2. Research how to get the remainder of a division using the 'modulus operator'.

Example:
- Below is what the final program output might look like:

    Please enter a number for X:
    7
    Please enter a number for Y:
    3
    X plus Y = 10
    X times Y = 21
    X minus Y = 4
    X divided by Y = 2.333333
